    magical tinkering:
      description: |
        At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic in objects that would otherwise be mundane. To use this ability, you must tinker’s tools, or other artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

        - The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
        - Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
        - The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
        - A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

        The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

        You can give the magic of this feature to multiple objects, touching one object each time you use the feature, and a single object can bear only one of the properties at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with the feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.
    spellcasting:
      description: |
        Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of
        the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your
        Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
        you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you
        cast and when making an attack roll with one.

        Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

        Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
    ritual casting:
      description: |
        You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
    infuse item:
      description: |
          At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions.
          The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.

          **Learning Infusions**

          - When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.
          - Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

          **Infusing an Item**

          - Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item, or you can forgo attunement so that someone else can attune to the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement.
          - Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.
          - You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.
    the right tool for the job:
      description: |
        At 3rd level, you learn how to produce exactly the tool you need: with tinker's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.
    eldritch cannon:
      level: 3
      description: |
        At 3rd level, you learn how to create a magical cannon. Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand.

        Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. or until you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is present. The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or saving throw, treat all it's ability scores as 10 (+0). If the Mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.

        When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannon table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.

        | Cannon | Activation |
        | -------- | -------- |
        | Flamethrower | The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. |
        | Force Ballista | Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the cannon, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the turret. |
        | Protector | The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). |
    arcane firearm:
      level: 5
      description: |
        At 5th level, you know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells. When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarvers' tools to carve special sigils into a wand, staff or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm. The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item.

        The sigils otherwise last indefinitely. You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you gain bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled. If the spell affects multiple creatures, one creature of your choice takes the bonus damage.

    constructed resilience:
      description: |
        You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:

        - You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
        - You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.
        - You are immune to disease.
        - You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.
    sentry's rest:
      description: |
        When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state,
        rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious,
        and you can see and hear as normal.
    integrated protection:
      description: |
        Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enchanced with armor.

        - You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
        - You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you must remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this way.
        - While you live, your armor can't be removed from your body against your will.

background:
  guild artisan:
    guild business:
      description: |
        As a member of your guild, you know the skills needed to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan's tools), as well as the principles of trade and good business practices. The question now is whether you abandon your trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to weave adventuring and trade together.
    guild membership:
      description: |
        As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.

        Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.

        You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.
